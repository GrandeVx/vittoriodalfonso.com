Rosy Landi is an Event/Wedding Planner based in Italy. She is a creative and passionate professional who loves crafting unique and unforgettable events. Her goal is to create a memorable experience for her clients, and to achieve this, she needed a website that reflected her personality and style. The website was envisioned to be elegant, modern, and user-friendly, showcasing her work in a captivating manner.

### Project Overview

Starting from an outdated WordPress theme-based website that no longer aligned with her needs and style, the existing site was slow, not optimized for search engines, and lacked mobile-friendliness. Consequently, we made the decision to completely redesign the website from scratch, aiming to enhance the user experience and present her work in a more engaging manner.

### Visual Emphasis

The focus was to be on the images, through which we aimed to convey the atmosphere and emotion of her events. Therefore, I opted to integrate an extensive photographic gallery, generating a dedicated page for each event.

### Technology Stack

The website was developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to ensure an optimal user experience, making it fully responsive and high-performing. To provide maximum convenience, I integrated a custom [CMS](https://strapi.io/), allowing her to update every detail of the website easily and quickly. This gives her the ability to independently upload new events and modify texts and images autonomously.
