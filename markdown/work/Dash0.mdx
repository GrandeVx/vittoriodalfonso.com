At Studio Lenzing, we crafted a community-focused brand and website for aspiring start-up Dash0 which is crafting development tools with weight on Observability and OpenTelemetry. CEO is Mirko Novakovic, who had previously led the development of [Istana](https://github.com/tailwindcss/typography/blob/master/README.md), a tool of similar use, which was later sold to IBM.

In the first phase, we focused on the visual and spiritual identity of the company. Through strategies like naming long and shortlists, visual research, and holistic analysis of the developer community, we shaped a brand that is approachable and friendly, yet techical enough to be serious and trustable.

With founder interviews and many extensive wireframing sessions, we then moved on to create the web experience: A landing page for the stealth product the teamâ€™s currently working on, as well as a blog to inform people and spread the topic of observability.
