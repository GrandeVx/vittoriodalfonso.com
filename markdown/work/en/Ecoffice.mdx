### Technology Stack

To solve the problem of digitalizing the "Waste Calendar" and ensure direct interaction with citizens, it was essential to choose a technology that offered speed, scalability and ease of use for both end users and administrators.

The mobile app was developed with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), tools that allow creating cross-platform applications with high performance. To make the interface even more modern and responsive, we adopted [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/), which facilitates the use of custom styles and ensures consistent design across all platforms.

On the backend front, a solution based on [TRPC](https://trpc.io/) was chosen, which allows creating typed and secure APIs, ensuring fluid communication between frontend and server. Integration with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) allowed efficient database management, while [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) was used for authentication and real-time data management, thus offering a robust and scalable system.

Finally, to complete the solution, a dedicated backoffice was developed. This tool allows the company to manage assistance, modify calendars and administer all operational functionalities in a single platform, centralizing control and improving overall operational efficiency.

This combination of technologies successfully addressed the challenge of digitalizing the "Waste Calendar", creating an integrated application that responds to the needs of a modern audience and ensures dynamic and secure data management.
