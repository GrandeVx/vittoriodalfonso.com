Koala represents the vanguard in the democratization of renewable energy through local energy communities. The landing page project had to communicate a revolutionary vision: making energy distributed, transparent and independent, giving local communities the tools to self-govern and generate shared value. The challenge was balancing technical complexity and communicative accessibility.

### Project Overview

The landing page had to serve multiple audiences: citizens interested in energy communities, public administrations, investors and technology partners. The goal was to create a narrative that made the benefits of energy communities tangible, while maintaining technical credibility for more sophisticated stakeholders.

### Visual Storytelling

In collaboration with the design team, we developed a narrative approach that guides the visitor through the journey from traditional centralized production towards a future of distributed energy. Using animated infographics and interactive data visualizations, the landing page makes complex concepts understandable such as local energy aggregation, energy balance and shared economic benefits.

### Technology Stack

The landing page was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for optimal performance and multilingual SEO. The interface uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with a customized design system developed by the design team that reflects sustainability values through natural palettes and modern typography. I implemented WebGL animations for interactive energy visualizations, translating the design concept into an immersive experience that differentiates Koala in the energy-tech sector.
