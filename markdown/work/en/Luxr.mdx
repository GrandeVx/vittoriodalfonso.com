Luxr is a complete platform for luxury transportation that revolutionizes the premium experience through a sophisticated web app. The platform allows users to register and access a complete ecosystem of services: booking one-way trips, round-trips, hourly services, and customizable tours. My role focused on developing the frontend of the web application, implementing an elegant interface that manages all the service functionalities.

### Project Overview

The main challenge was to create a complete user experience that handled all aspects of luxury transportation. The application had to allow users to:

- **Register and manage their profile** with personalized preferences
- **Book flexible trips**: one-way, round-trip, or hourly services
- **Create custom tours** choosing points to visit or selecting preset tours
- **View complete history** of all trips made
- **Communicate directly** with the driver during service

All while maintaining a refined aesthetic that distinguished Luxr from mainstream competitors.

### Design and User Experience

The interface was designed by the design team to balance minimalism and functionality, using a dark color palette with golden accents to communicate exclusivity. The booking flow was optimized to reduce necessary steps, allowing users to book luxury transport with the same ease as traditional ride-sharing, but with customized options for specific preferences. My contribution focused on the technical implementation of this design vision.

### Communication and Trip Management

The application included a direct messaging system with the driver and notifications for trip status updates. Users could view the complete history of their previous trips with all booking details. These features were essential to maintain the high service standards that luxury segment clients expect.
