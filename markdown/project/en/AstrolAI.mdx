Astrol AI is a personal project I developed to explore the integration between artificial intelligence and conversational services, creating a complete ecosystem for personalized horoscopes. The project combines a Python Telegram bot, a Next.js landing page, Stripe payment system, and an automated pipeline for generating astral content.

### Technical Overview

The project is structured as a multi-component ecosystem:
- **Telegram Bot**: Python with python-telegram-bot for conversation management
- **AI Engine**: Claude API for contextual astrological response generation
- **Landing Page**: Next.js with internationalization and dark/light theme
- **Payment System**: Stripe for Basic/Premium subscription management
- **Content Pipeline**: Automated system for visual asset creation

### Bot and AI Architecture

The Telegram bot implements:
- **Conversation Handler**: Conversation state management with persistence
- **User Management**: Usage tracking, plan limits, conversation history
- **AI Integration**: Claude API with prompt engineering for astrological responses
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe webhooks for subscription status management
- **Logging System**: Complete performance monitoring and usage analytics

### Content Generation Pipeline

I developed an automated system for visual content creation:
- **Template System**: Custom backgrounds for each zodiac sign
- **Text Overlay**: Text rendering system with custom fonts and shadows
- **Social Assets**: Automatic image generation for different formats
- **Daily Generation**: Cron jobs for daily content creation
- **Image Processing**: Python pipeline with PIL for image manipulation
