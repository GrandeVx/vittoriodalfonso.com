### Project Overview

The primary goal of the research was to investigate the properties of twin primes—pairs of prime numbers that are only two units apart—and develop algorithms that could reliably generate them. Twin primes have long been a topic of interest in number theory, with implications in fields like cryptography due to their role in data encryption. Our research proposes new algorithms that substantially reduce the computational effort required to find twin primes compared to classical methods.

The research involved creating a smart algorithm, which was able to handle large-scale computations with reduced complexity. This design allowed us to identify twin prime pairs up to very high values, showcasing the algorithm's efficiency.

### Technology Stack

We leveraged Python and high-performance computing environments like JupyterLab for running simulations and testing our algorithms. The algorithms were implemented using matrix operations and polynomial regressions, providing insights into the distribution of twin primes and their behavior at larger scales.
