Wardrobe is a personal mobile application project I developed to explore the potential of React Native with Expo in creating a social experience in the fashion world. The app combines digital wardrobe management, AI outfit suggestions, and social features in a single platform. The project uses a monorepo architecture with Turbo and includes both the mobile app and the web landing page.
